# Academic Documentation Site

This is the public repository for <https://sourcethemes.com/academic/>, a static website generated by [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/).

If you find any errors in our docs or have suggestions, please submit an issue or pull request.

For minor changes like typos, you can click **Edit this page**, located at the bottom of the right sidebar on most documentation pages. This will take you to an online editor where you can modify the page and submit a pull request for your change to be reviewed.

For larger edits or new pages, you'll want to set up a local environment for editing:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-www.git
cd academic-www
hugo server
```

## Add your site to the showcase
